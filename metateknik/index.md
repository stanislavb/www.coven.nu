## Lotteri

Varje spelare kommer att börja lajvet med 1-3 av de fem krafterna. Under spelets gång kan du som spelare prata med en medlem ur hushållet om att få fler kraft, en i taget. 

Vilken ny kraft du får är utlottat. Detta går ut på att dra en pärla ur en påse: färgen på pärlan symboliserar en kraft. När en ny kraft blivit dragen får spelaren ett kuvert med samma färg som pärlan, innehållandes en kort beskrivning av kraften och en påminnelse om hur den ska användas. Pärlan är också en symbol IN till andra spelare om vilka krafter du har att använda. De kan sitta på ett halsband eller armband men ska alltid hållas synliga för andra spelare. 

Den nya kraften behöver inte sättas i spel direkt, du som spelare kan välja att öppna kuvertat och sätta pärlan med dina andra vid ett senare tillfälle. Kuverten finns inte IN, men kan lämnas synliga för att ge andra spelare möjligheten att spela på misstankar om dina begynnande krafter, om du vill. Det är dock först när pärlan sitter på ditt halsband/armband som du och dina medspelare kan spela på din nya kraft fullt ut.

Du som spelare väljer själv om du vill få alla fem krafterna under lajvets gång eller inte få några nya alls. Om du vill delta i De Sju Proven som sker på andra dagen, så behöver du ha minst tre krafter före den eftermiddagen.

## Kutt och brems

Both of these will mean the same thing: stop what you are doing something is wrong in this scene. This can be anything from a player being about to do something they are not allowed to do OFF, to a player being overwhelmed by a situation and needing help OFF. When you hear someone shout "Cut" or "Break" you do not need to rush over. It is much better to simply stop where you are and let the situation be resolved by those involved and the organizers if needed. Once the situation is resolved the play can continue.

## Metateknik

These are ways in which we can communicate between players in-game without having to stop the game completely and break character. As a player if you see or hear these techniques and they are not being directed to you personally, you most often ignore them, they do not exist in the in-game world.

There are different interpretations of all meta-techniques depending on the country or even the community they are being used in. Because of this please read our interpretations carefully even if you feel you are already familiar with these techniques. These are the versions we will use at our LARP.

## Rött, grönt, gult

Also known as the Stoplight System this meta-technique is used to gage the bounderies of the player in a scene before taking action. 

Red: for stop this scene. It is not the same as break or cut. The players do not need to go out of character. They simply end the scene and do something else.

Green: for yes or please escalate. 

Yellow: here's fine but no further. Keep this level but do not escalate.

An example of the system in use would be a bullying scene where one player is dominating the other: 
The dominant player might get the idea that it would suit the scene to become more physical and can communicate this by for example pushing or grabbing the other player; thereby indicating the direction the dominant player is trying to take the scene. The dominant player can now ask if the other player is comfortable with this new direction by asking if it is: "Green?". 

In reply the other player can say "Green" to mean 'yes I think this is a good idea and I'm ok with us escalating to controlled physical violence', "Red" to say 'no I think this scene should come to an end now' or "Yellow" to say 'I'm fine with what we were doing, I don't feel comfortable escalating it'.

In this example the dominant player in the scene led, but it can just as easily be used by the other player in the scene. You also do not have to be asked in order to use the system. You can use Red, Green, Yellow to indicate how you feel in a scene even without being asked; to show your bounderies in the scene or to give your consent.

## Ping-Pong

This system is a quick but importat meta-technique to check the well being of your co-player. 

It is not unusal to be confused over a co-players fantastic acting: I'm serious. As a player you might start to question wheter another player is actually acting or genuinly not feeling ok anymore. But since you're unsure, and you don't want to use cut to check in case you're wrong, there's the Ping-Pong system. 

Discreetly whisper "Ping" into your co-players ear and wait for them to respond with "Pong". If you recieve a clear "Pong": you know they are fine and you can continue your play. If the player does not respond, you now know to use cut and to remove the player from the situation. Find organizers. However a response from your co-player is not automatically ok. Think carefully; did the response come quickly? clearly? did the person sound distressed when giving it? People can go into chock or simply be afraid to cause trouble despite feeling bad. If you are unsatisfied with the response you got we trust you to cut the scene and help your co-player. As organizers we will always prefer that you reacted extra caustiously to not at all.
