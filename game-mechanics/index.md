## Meta techniques

## The Lottery System

Each player will begin with 1-3 out of the 5 powers. During the game the players can communicate with a member of ‘the household’ about receiving a new power. The lotto system consists of pulling a coloured bead out of a bag; each power is represented by a colour. Once a new power has been chosen the player receives an envelope in the colour of their new power containing a short note and a reminder of how the power works. 

The bead is an IN symbol to other players of what powers you have. They can be either a necklace or a bracelet but should be visible to other players at all times.

The new power does not have to be played on straight away. The player can even choose to open the letter at a later time. The letters are a meta-technique and are not visible to other players. They can however be left out openly to allow other players to ‘sense’ or ‘suspect’ a new power is developing or to simply remind others of what powers you have. The power should not be played on however by other players, whether the letter is opened or not. It is not until the bead is placed on the necklace or bracelet that the player had put their new power into play.

A player can choose to receive no new powers at all or all 5 powers, at any pace they choose. You must have at least three powers by the afternoon of the second day if you wish to enter into The Seven Wonders.
