## Vision

Coven is a LARP about witches, power, horror and the bonds which are formed and broken under extreme pressure. 

It is a three day LARP with a clear narrative for each day. The playing style is pressure cooker and meta techniques will be used to represent the powers and magic at the LARP.

*[pressure cooker]: A playing style where conflicts and drama are not played openly for all to see. They are instead played out behind closed doors or in small groups.

## Background

The LARP is an alternative ending to the series. Instead of the The Coven ‘winning’ and beating the Witch Hunters, in this world the Witch Hunters ‘won’ and continue to exterminate Coven after Coven. The few that remain are in hiding and many witches have renounced their powers and assimilated into the rest of society. The few Covens remaining are mostly resigned to their fate.

Even The Witches Council seemed to have given up. Then suddenly something changed. The Witch Hunters stopped focusing on Covens as their main target and started going after individual witches. First previous Coven members, but then they started targeting anyone with magical potential, sinisterly before many of them were even aware of their own legacy.The Witches Council was forced to step in, rescuing young witches and sending them to the few Covens still undiscovered by the Witch Hunters. 

This is the premise for the LARP. 12-15 newly rescued witches arrive at a Swedish Coven to discover their powers, each other and the life threatening danger they all face.

## Inspiration

The LARP was inspired foremost by the television series American Horror Story: Coven. However much has been changed and adjusted so there is no need to have watched the series before the LARP.

Other sources of inspiration include Buffy the Vampire Slayer season 7; where a group of newly activated slayers must come to terms with their powers in the midst of a mystical war.

X-Men or more specifically 'Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters'; the Coven has primarily been a place of learning to handle your powers.

Lindängens Riksinternat; a LARP about a private boarding school where hazing, bullying and abuse of power is common and encouraged under the cover of Tradition. Similarly Covens are not always the best institutions to be stuck in.

## Too much information

This LARP uses transparency with its players as much as possible to ensure that they can plan their own narrative accordingly. There will also be times where, depending on the players actions IN game, they will be required to go OFF with the organizers to plan scenes.
