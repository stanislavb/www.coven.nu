## Vision

Coven utspelar sig i en, rätt ofrivilligt, nyformad samling häxor i nutidens Sverige. 

Lajvet handlar om coola krafter, häxorna som innehar dem, och de personer som försöker döda dem för att de innehar dem. Du får en chans att uppleva klassiska känslor och karaktärer från gymnasietiden, skaffa nya vänner, bli sviken, bli kär, råka döda någon och desperat försöka återuppliva dem innan kårchefen får reda på det...eller bara försöka täcka dina spår.

Stämningen är spänd, framtiden är osäker och du har antingen alldeles för lite eller alldeles för mycket kraft att hantera läget. Du måste skaffa vänner. Du måste ha tillit. Ni måste hjälpa varandra eller så kommer ni antagligen att dö i en alldeles för snar framtid. 

Men först måste du ta reda på var det största hotet ligger; utanför er samling eller i dess mitt?

## Inspiration

The LARP was inspired foremost by the American tv-series "American Horror Story: Coven". A series about a Coven of witches in New Orleans, present day. Since then "Cirkeln", a swedish film based on a book about witches in present day Sweden, has come out. We see many parallels with our vision there too and have decided to draw inspiration from both.

Other sources of inspiration include: 

Buffy the Vampire Slayer season 7: where a group of newly activated slayers must come to terms with their powers and each other, in the midst of a mystical war. 

X-Men or more specifically "Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters": the Covens have primarily been a place of teaching young witches to handle their powers. 

Lindängens Riksinternat: a LARP about a private boarding school where hazing, bullying and abuse of power was common, and encouraged under the cover of "tradition". Similarly Covens are not always the best institutions to be stuck in.

## Ytterligare information

This LARP uses transparency with its players as much as possible to ensure that they can plan their own narrative accordingly. There will also be times where, depending on the players actions IN game, they will be required to go OFF with the organizers to plan scenes.

Things to learn will be kept to a minimum so that the players can focus on enjoying and exploring the LARP. There will however be some game-mechanics and meta-techniques which the players will be required to learn in order to participate. These will be drilled as much as possible at the preLARP workshop, but since the LARP is designed so that players have almost nothing else to learn or prepare, you will be expected to show up already reasonably proficient. All the neccessary information will be availiable on this site.

Being confident with the techniques the LARP uses will allow the players to have fun with their powers and use them to create great moments for themselves and others; invent rituals, tease each other, defend yourself and really immerse in the world.

## Säkerhet

There will be members of the Household moving about the area during the LARP. The Household is a mix of Helpers and Organizers and can always be pulled aside if you need to ask something or report a problem. 

Any problems you bring to the Household will be taken seriously, and we will attempt to deal with any problems, questions or requests as swiftly as possible. Problems involving other players will always be dealt with as a team and no indiviual member of the Household will be taking major safety decisions alone. This however does not include cases where patricipants are in direct danger; such as fire or violence. 

All players have signed a participant contract and any player who breaks this agreement will be asked to leave. To read the participant contract look under Practical.

The LARP will use the Red, Green, Yellow system and the Ping-Pong system for safe play and a system for sex is being decided upon. To read more about these techniques go to Game Mechanics.
