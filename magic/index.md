## The Five Powers

As the Covens died out and witches stopped using their gifts the powers got weaker and many disappeared almost all together. Mortis, Vitalis, Concilium, Clairvoyance and Transferal are the most commonly seen of the remaining powers. There have through the generations existed several different variants and mutations but all the remaining powers can be traced back as originating from the seven main powers: The Seven Wonders. 

### Mortis: Touch of Death

The power to take life is the second most potent power and very hard to control. It originates from the Wonder: Descensum. 

Mortis requires skin to skin contact with the victim; the words ‘Alma, Mortis’ are spoken and the victim will immediately feel their body begin to shut down. 

Mortis manifests differently depending on the witch casting it; some can only cast it when taken over by a strong emotion, some have no control at all and cast it without intention, some can cast it at will but require more skin contact to do so. 

### Vitalis: Power of Resurrection

The power to return life to the dead is the most potent power remaining and can be difficult to perfect, often needing much practice. It originates from the Wonder: Vitalum Vitalis.

Vitalis doesn’t require skin to skin contact but some witches find this gives better results; the words ‘Alma, Vitalis’ are spoken before gently blowing on the victims face. It can take a little time for the victim to regain the full function of their body.

Mastering Vitalis successfully is no easy feat and the side effects of being raised from the dead can be dire if it is not done correctly. Zombification, loss of speech or sight can be some of the results of an unfinished or badly executed Vitalis. Luckily it can often be corrected by more powerful Vitalis.

The after effects of being raised back from the dead can give the victim a euphoric high comparable with some drugs, this has resulted in some witches using Mortis and Vitalis on each other to get a kick. There are of course many risks, the longer the victim is under the better the high, but the stronger the witch needs to be in order to resurrect correctly. Mortis from some witches can also result in a bad trip.

### Concilium: Mind Control

The power to control another’s mind and by extension often their body. It originates from the Wonder: Concilium.

Concilium varies slightly depending on the ability and strength of the caster. Eye contact with the victim is always required and the words ‘Alma, Concilium’ are followed by instructions i.e. ‘Alma, Concilium. Slap yourself’ or a more complex variant could be ‘Alma, Concilium: Go make me a cup of tea’. The strength of the caster versus the strength of the victim is relevant when using Concilium; a stronger witch might be able to resist a Concilium by a weaker witch. Even a weaker witch might snap out of Concilium mid-tea brewing. Concilium might leave a victim feeling confused and disoriented or have them trapped, fully aware of their actions but unable to stop themselves. 

A good indicator that Concilium has been used is the sharp but temporary headache that often follows a longer Concilium exposure, if the victim is being exposed to Concilium repeatedly or has been under Concilium for some time this can even lead to migraines, nausea and vomiting.

### Clarvoyance: Mind Reading

The power to read anothers thoughts. It originates from the Wonder: Clarvoyance.

Clarvoyance and Concilium have a lot of similarities; both vary slightly depending on the ability and strength of the caster and both require eye contact with the victim. Clarvoyance however is much harder to break if there is also skin contact between the victim and the caster. The words ‘Alma, Clarvoyance’ are spoken and the victim will start speaking their thoughts aloud; sometimes they do not notice themselves doing this, sometimes they do but cannot stop themselves.

As with Concilium the strength of the caster versus the strength of the victim is relevant; a stronger witch might be able to resist or break the Clarvoyance of a weaker witch. 

### Transferal: Shifting injury to others

The power to transfer pain and injury onto others. It originates from the Wonder: Transmutation.

Transferal requires that the caster has eye contact with their victim throughout the Transferal and loss of eye contact breaks the Transferal, but will not undo the damage already transferred. The caster establishes eye contact, says the words ‘Alma, Transferal’ and then causes damage to their own body in some way i.e. slaps their own face or stabs a fork in their hand. The victim feels the pain in the casters place and will also sustain the damage to their body even after the Transferal is broken. 

It is harder for a weaker witch to break the Transferal by a stronger witch, but the Transferal can be broken by a third person breaking the eye contact between caster and victim.
